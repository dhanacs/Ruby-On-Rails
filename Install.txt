RubyGems is a package manager.
The command line tool fetches these packages from the central repository and installs them.

Rake is a software task management and build automation tool.
It allows the user to specify tasks and describe dependencies as well as to group tasks in a namespace.
e.g.
rake db:migrate
rake db:seed

c:>gem install rails
c:>gem install rake
c:>gem install nodejs-rails
c:>rails -v
